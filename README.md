# IS452_FinalProject

## File Processing Across Science Domains with Python 

Abstract: 

 I want to do a half research and half coding project, where I use python to read in and parse different file types from difference science domains. For instance, some disciplines store everything in text files, others in json, others in specialized file types. I’d like to pick 3-5 science domains, find some free data sources, research how to handle the files and any metadata, and try to develop a program that will read in and make sense of the file contents for each dataset. By making sense of the contents, I mean the data should be formatted in either a human readable way or according to the domain standard.  

The purpose of this project is to: 

- Work on my file reading abilities in python 
- Investigate a systemic way of handling files in python from different perspectives  
- Understand how to handle metadata 
- Develop skills on how to handle different types of data 

So far, I have identified a free data source: https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets.  

Domains I’d like to focus on (as of this week): Atomic energy, Oceanography, and Climate/Weather 


Deliverables:  

1. Py files with code for each domain 
2. Domain datasets 
3. PDF with research summary 

I think these deliverables will be enough to encapsulate my project – it includes the data, the code to run the data, and the documentation of what I did and the resources I used.  


Midpoint check in deliverables: 

1. Have the domain datasets  
2. Have an idea how to read them in (some basic working code, ideally) 
3. Have resources on each domain 


Workflow: 

1. Get data and metadata from data sources 
2. I’ve found several free data sources already! 
3. Depending on the file type, read the files in correctly using python (either base python or an external library) 
4. This will depend on the file type and the domain. I’ll use what simplest or what the domain standard is.  
5. Parse files according to domain standard 
- I anticipate this will take the longest and will take quite a bit of research. I want to get the data into a human readable state, or in state where some potential visualization or analysis could be done 
6. This could also include data cleaning steps 
7. Explore data to make sure things are done correctly 
8. This will likely be an iterative process, and I may go through several datasets or domains.  


Challenges: 

I anticipate finding the right data set will be the first challenge. It will also take time to find, read in, and explore it enough to decide if it’s the right fit. The next challenge will be understanding the data for each domain. So, it will be finding a dataset that has adequate documentation and metadata to make sense of data from a domain I’m not familiar with. Parsing the data well will test my python skills, and I’m sure challenges will arise here, but I’m not sure exactly what those will be. Knowing when I’m done with each dataset. At what point is the data useful? I suspect this will be different for each domain.
